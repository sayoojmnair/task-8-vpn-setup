# Task 8: VPN Setup and Testing

## 🎯 Objective
To gain hands-on experience with VPNs, understand how they protect privacy, and analyze their benefits and limitations.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- ProtonVPN Free (Desktop Client)
- whatismyipaddress.com (for IP verification)

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Signed up for ProtonVPN free account.
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client.
3. Connected to a VPN server (Netherlands server).
4. Verified IP change using whatismyipaddress.com.
5. Browsed websites to confirm encrypted traffic.
6. Disconnected VPN and compared browsing speed & IP.
7. Researched VPN features, encryption, and limitations.

## 📸 Screenshots
- IP address before VPN connection
- VPN client showing connected state
- IP address after VPN connection

## ⚠️ Findings
- IP address successfully changed, proving VPN tunnel is active.
- Verified encryption using ProtonVPN (AES-256 with OpenVPN protocol).
- Browsing speed decreased slightly when VPN was enabled.
- VPN improved privacy by masking real IP and location.

## 📝 Key Learnings
- VPNs protect privacy by encrypting internet traffic and hiding the real IP.
- They prevent tracking and eavesdropping on public Wi-Fi.
- VPNs cannot guarantee 100% anonymity (provider logs, browser fingerprinting still possible).
- Free VPNs often have limited bandwidth and fewer servers.
- Paid VPNs offer better speed, stability, and privacy features.
